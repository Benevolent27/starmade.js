things to do:
1. see why the connect event is firing off so many damn times
2. Have authentication on by default in the server.cfg file after install
3.  Fix the following death situations:
A. player in a factioned ship kills me.  The factionObj is not being returned.  It might be necessary to get the factionObj of the base entity.. though this would not be accurate since this is currently bugged.. hmm
B. astronaut kills another astronaut.  The responsibleEntityObj is a PlayerObj rather than the killerObj
4. Test deaths:
star
blackhole
asteroidWeapon
asteroidTurretWeapon
PlanetWeapon
PlanetTurretWeapon
Mines -- this needs to be added
5. Post install, add more setup questions to handle:
A. Turn authentication on by default:
USE_STARMADE_AUTHENTICATION = true //allow star-made.org authentication
REQUIRE_STARMADE_AUTHENTICATION = true //require star-made.org authentication (USE_STARMADE_AUTHENTICATION must be true)
B. Set up other common settings changes, such as sector size.
C. Set up the optimization settings, such as core count.
